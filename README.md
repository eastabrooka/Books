[	Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now - Jaron Lanier	](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arguments-Deleting-Social-Media-Accounts/dp/1847925391)
I found this book really disappointing.
The first part focuses on how our minds are being taken over by forces that want to change our behaviour in a sinister way.
In reality the vast majority of the time they're just advertisers trying to sell us a new type of coffee or something.
Gave up a third of the way through. Maybe the ending was cracking who knows.

Whilst its definitely worth considering how much time (if any) you spend on social media and what impact its having on you..
With some books I read I wonder why I bother as I really know the information anyway.
